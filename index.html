                    The fact that I have become familiar with the basics of Umbraco 7 and more, being able to make my own document types, templates, partial views, macros, custom macro parameters, property editors and styles management. During this time, where I have made
                    my own site, I have learned how the structure of the different templates can affect the behavior of the macros, and how the macros need to be prepared for each scenario. Also, by building custom macro parameters, I have been able to
                    improve the user experience. With that, I made sure that the different templates and macros meet the requirements and their behavior changed depending on different circumstances such as used browsers and resolutions.
